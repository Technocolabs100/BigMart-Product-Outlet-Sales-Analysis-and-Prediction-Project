# Bigmart Sales Analysis
## Hypothesis Generation
## Introduction
This project involves examining sales data from a Bigmart store with the goal of understanding the factors that influence sales and creating predictive models to forecast future sales. To achieve this, we will employ Hypothesis Generation to identify possible factors that could have an impact on sales.

## Loading Packages and Data
We initiated the project by importing the required packages such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, which will be utilized for the analysis. The dataset employed in this study was provided by Bigmart and encompasses details about sales, product characteristics, and store locations.

## Data Structure and Content
Subsequently, we proceeded to examine the format and contents of the dataset. The data comprises a mix of numerical and categorical variables. Additionally, we identified the presence of missing values within the dataset, necessitating appropriate handling and treatment.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In order to gain a deeper understanding of the data, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA). This involved analyzing the distribution and correlation of the variables present in the dataset. To facilitate this analysis, we generated visualizations to visualize and comprehend the relationships between the variables.

## Univariate Analysis
During this stage, we conducted a thorough analysis of each variable individually to detect any discernible patterns or trends. This analysis encompassed calculating summary statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, as well as generating visualizations, such as histograms or box plots, to provide a visual representation of the data's distribution and characteristics for each variable.

## Bivariate Analysis
Subsequently, we proceeded to explore the relationships between pairs of variables in the dataset. This analysis involved evaluating correlations between variables and constructing scatterplots to visualize the associations between them. By examining these relationships, we aimed to uncover any potential connections or dependencies between different variables within the dataset.

## Missing Value Treatment
Upon identifying the presence of missing values in the dataset, we implemented strategies to handle them effectively. These strategies involved employing techniques such as imputation, where missing values were replaced with the mean or median value of the respective variable. Alternatively, in certain cases, rows containing missing values were dropped from the dataset altogether. By employing these approaches, we aimed to ensure the integrity and completeness of the data for subsequent analysis.

## Feature Engineering
During this stage, we engaged in feature engineering by generating new features from the existing variables in the dataset. This process encompassed various techniques such as combining variables to create new ones, computing ratios between variables, and creating dummy variables for categorical variables. By creating these new features, we aimed to extract additional insights and enhance the predictive power of our models.

## Encoding Categorical Variables
Following feature engineering, we proceeded to encode the categorical variables present in the dataset. To achieve this, we employed two common techniques: Label Encoding and One Hot Encoding. Label Encoding involves assigning unique numerical labels to each category within a categorical variable. On the other hand, One Hot Encoding creates binary variables for each category, representing their presence or absence in a given observation. By performing these encoding techniques, we transformed the categorical variables into numerical values that could be utilized in subsequent modeling tasks.

## Preprocessing Data
Prior to commencing with the modeling phase, we conducted data preprocessing steps. This involved scaling the numerical variables to ensure that they were on a similar scale, which can aid in model performance. Additionally, we partitioned the data into separate training and testing sets. The training set was utilized to train the models, while the testing set was employed to evaluate their performance on unseen data. This division helps in assessing the model's ability to generalize to new observations.

## Modeling
In the final stage of the analysis, we constructed predictive models employing three distinct techniques: Linear Regression, Regularized Linear Regression, and Random Forest. Additionally, to further enhance the accuracy of our models, we leveraged XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm. By employing these various modeling approaches, we aimed to develop robust and accurate models for forecasting sales based on the identified factors and patterns within the data.

## Conclusion
By employing Hypothesis Generation and conducting a thorough analysis of the Bigmart sales data, we successfully identified the critical factors that have a significant impact on sales. Furthermore, we constructed predictive models that are capable of accurately forecasting future sales. By implementing these models in practical settings, Bigmart can strategically optimize their sales strategies and ultimately enhance their overall profitability and business performance.
